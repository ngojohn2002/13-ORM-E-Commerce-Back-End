## Description
The E-Commerce Backend System is designed to provide robust API services for managing an e-commerce platformâ€™s inventory. This backend system allows users to perform CRUD operations on products, categories, and tags through a clean and easy-to-use API interface. Developed using Express.js and Sequelize, it connects seamlessly with a PostgreSQL database, ensuring efficient data handling and security.
